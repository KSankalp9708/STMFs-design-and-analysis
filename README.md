# STMFs-design-and-analysis
Modeled and analyzed Special Truss Moment Frames (STMFs) in OpenSeesPy, replicating PBPD literature, developing elastic and nonlinear fiber-section models, and validating seismic behavior. Established a computational workflow for scaling to multi-bay, multi-story frames.
